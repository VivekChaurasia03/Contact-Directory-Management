# Project Overview

## Key Project Highlights

### Authentication and Authorization Implementation
- **Implemented Comprehensive Authentication and Authorization System**:
    - Developed secure login mechanisms using username/password and integrated OAuth2 for Google and GitHub authentication.
    - Utilized Spring Security to protect URLs and ensure only authenticated users could access sensitive areas like `/user/dashboard`.
    - Leveraged `UserDetailService` and `DaoAuthenticationProvider` to authenticate users against a database, implementing custom user services and extending the `UserDetails` interface.

### User Management and Role-Based Access Control
- **Enhanced User Management with Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Designed and implemented role-based access control using `@ElementCollection` to assign roles such as `ADMIN` and `USER`, with Hibernate automatically creating necessary tables.
    - Controlled URL access by creating a `SecurityFilterChain` bean using `HttpSecurity`, allowing fine-grained authorization rules and custom login/logout forms.

### Additional Technical Achievements

#### Seamless Third-Party Authentication
- **Integrated Third-Party Authentication for Enhanced User Experience**:
    - Configured OAuth2 for Google and GitHub, obtaining client IDs and secrets, and implemented custom success handlers to process user information post-authentication.
    - Ensured secure handling of sensitive information by using environment variables (`env.properties`) and integrating with Spring Boot properties.

#### Advanced Features and Enhancements
- **Developed Advanced Features and User Experience Enhancements**:
    - Implemented pagination for contact listings using Spring Data's `Pageable` module, enabling efficient data retrieval and display.
    - Added functionality for viewing and managing contacts through modals and AJAX, improving user interaction and application responsiveness.
    - Developed custom validators and services for image processing and uploading using Cloudinary, ensuring robust media handling in the application.

#### Security and Email Verification
- **Enhanced Security and User Verification Processes**:
    - Implemented email verification processes using Mailtrap to ensure account authenticity, and updated the user status upon successful verification.
    - Designed custom handlers for error and success scenarios during email verification, providing clear feedback to users and maintaining application integrity.
